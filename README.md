# React-Recipe-App üç≤

 <br>



#### This is a recipe application. We see the foods in the project through an API. When a word about the desired food is typed in the search section, we can access all the foods in that word. When we click on the letters at the bottom of the page, foods starting with that letter appear. The materials used in the foods, how the food is made, and the youtube video of the food are also available. This project was completed using CSS, Tailwind, and React.js and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic React.js features. The project was made as a responsive design.<br> <br> <br>

My achievements were:
- Master layout creation
- CSS
- Tailwind
- React hooks
- Regular Expression
- Responsive Design
- API
- React Router DOM
